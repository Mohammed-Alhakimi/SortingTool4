     A project created in my journy of learning JAVA development in JetBrains Academy.
During this course, I was able to gain a lot of knowldge in generics, and different kinds of Trees in JAVA. I have used the Factory design pattern to create different kinds of finders.I have also used different kinds of sorting algorithms such as merge sort and quick Sort.
